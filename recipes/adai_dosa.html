    <h2>Description</h2>    
    <p>Ada (adai) is a dosa  usually served at breakfast. <br>It is made with a mixture of lentils and rice and is quite filling. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>


   <li>1 cup split Bengal gram (chana dal)</li> 

   <li> 1 cup skinned split black lentils (urad dal)</li>

   <li> 1/2 cup split yellow lentils (moong dal)</li>

   <li> 1 cup rice</li>

    <li> water, as needed</li>

    <li>2 dried red chile peppers, or to taste
    </li>
   <li> salt to taste</li>

    <li>2 tablespoons cumin seeds</li>

<li>    2 tablespoons cooking oil</li>

    </ul>
    <b>Step 1</b>
    <p>Combine chana dal, urad dal, moong dal, and rice in a large bowl; cover with several inches of cool water. Soak 8 hours to overnight.</p>

        
    <b>Step 2</b>  
    <p>Grind soaked dal-rice mixture, chile peppers, and salt into a paste using a mortar and pestle; transfer to a bowl. Add enough water to make a batter just thin enough to spread; stir in cumin seeds.</p>
    <b>Step 3</b>     
    <p>Heat a griddle (or a tawa) over medium heat; lightly grease with oil around edges and in the middle. Ladle some batter on the tawa; spread into a thin circle using the back of the ladle or a large spoon. Cook about 3 minutes, then flip. Cook about 3 minutes more; transfer to a plate and serve immediately. Adas are best eaten hot off the griddle. Repeat with remaining batter. </p>
