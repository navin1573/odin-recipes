        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Idli is a popular South Indian dish, typically served for breakfast. <br>It is made with fermented rice and urad dal (black gram), and is known for its soft and fluffy texture.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
   <li>2 cups rice</li> 
   <li>1 cup urad dal (split black lentils)</li>
   <li>1/2 teaspoon fenugreek seeds</li>
   <li>Water, as needed</li>
   <li>Salt, to taste</li>
</ul>

<b>Step 1</b>
<p>Rinse the rice and urad dal separately. Soak the rice and fenugreek seeds together in a bowl, and the urad dal in another bowl. Soak for 6-8 hours or overnight.</p>

<b>Step 2</b>  
<p>Grind the soaked urad dal into a smooth paste using water as needed. Similarly, grind the soaked rice mixture into a coarse batter. Combine both the rice and dal batters in a large bowl, and add salt to taste. Stir well to mix.</p>

<b>Step 3</b>  
<p>Cover the batter and let it ferment in a warm place for 8-12 hours, or until it doubles in size and becomes slightly bubbly. Fermentation is key to making soft and fluffy idlis.</p>

<b>Step 4</b>   
<p>Once the batter has fermented, grease the idli molds and pour the batter into the molds. Steam the idlis in a steamer or pressure cooker (without the pressure) for about 10-15 minutes, or until they are cooked through and a toothpick inserted comes out clean.</p>

<b>Step 5</b>   
<p>Serve the idlis hot with chutney and sambar. Enjoy!</p>
