    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chapathi (also known as Roti) is a soft, flat, and unleavened bread made from whole wheat flour. <br>It is commonly served with curries, vegetables, and lentil dishes in many Indian households.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups whole wheat flour (atta)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>Water, as needed</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons oil (optional, for softer chapathi)</li>
    </ul>

    <b>Step 1</b>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the whole wheat flour and salt. Gradually add water and mix until the dough begins to come together.</p>

    <b>Step 2</b>  
    <p>Knead the dough for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and soft. If the dough feels sticky, add a little more flour; if it feels too dry, add a few drops of water. Cover the dough and let it rest for 20-30 minutes.</p>

    <b>Step 3</b>  
    <p>After resting, divide the dough into small equal-sized balls (about the size of a golf ball). Roll each ball into a smooth ball and flatten it slightly with your fingers.</p>

    <b>Step 4</b>   
    <p>Using a rolling pin, roll each dough ball into a thin, round disc (about 6-8 inches in diameter) on a lightly floured surface.</p>

    <b>Step 5</b>  
    <p>Heat a griddle (tawa) over medium heat. Once hot, place the rolled-out chapathi onto the griddle. Cook for about 30 seconds until you see bubbles forming on the surface. Flip the chapathi and cook for another 30 seconds.</p>

    <b>Step 6</b>  
    <p>Press gently with a cloth or spatula to help it puff up. Flip again and cook for another 10-15 seconds. Once done, remove from the griddle and keep warm in a cloth or container.</p>

    <b>Step 7</b>   
    <p>Serve the chapathi hot with curry, vegetables, or yogurt. Enjoy!</p>
